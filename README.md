# experiment
This is an experimental project, which I hope will continue for at least two (maybe more) years.

I once heard that fields like statistics, unlike the natural sciences, don't always require researchers to conduct physical experiments. However, statisticians must simulate and analyze real data to make their theories and methodologies convincing. This is quite different from other experiment-driven sciences, and sometimes I envy the pure satisfaction of a well-executed experiment.

But then, I was told that in statistics, replication is our experiment. This idea resonated with me, inspiring the creation of this project, guided by the famous principle: "learning by doing." My plan is to select articles from various journals—regardless of the quality of the article—follow their main ideas, and replicate their simulations. I believe this will sharpen my coding skills along the way.

I hope you're as excited about this project as I am. Enjoy!
