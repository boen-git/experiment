# experiment
This is an experimental project. Hopefully, it will carry on for at least 2 years.

Once I had been told that statistics, as well as some other non-natural sciences, doesn't need researchers to conduct a real experiment, but it does require statistician to simulate and analysis real data to make their theories and methodologies convincing.
This is quite different from other experiment-based science, which sometime makes me envy about those pure pleasure of a wonderful experiment.

However, once I had alse been told that, in statistics, replication is our experiment. From my perspective, this statement enlightened me and so I came up with this project, hoping to follow up the famous quote: 'learning by doing'. Here I will (hopefully) select articles from certain journals, no matter how good or bad the article is, just follow their brief ideas, and then simulate their simulations. I believe this project will shapen my coding skills.

I hope you are as excited as me when you see this project. Enjoy!
